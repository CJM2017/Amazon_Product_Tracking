# Amazon Product Tracker

### Purpose
Provide a web based platform for tracking product price points on the Amazon market. The front end is written with node.js and uses the express framework to handle routing client requests. As of now, I provide three views: 
- One to submit the product URl, your desired purchasing price point, and notifcation settings
- One to view the current state of all of your products
- One to view a historic plot of product pricing
